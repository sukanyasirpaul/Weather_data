🌤 Weather Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python
📘 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a weather dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly).
The analysis explores temperature, ozone, wind speed, and solar radiation patterns across different months and weather types (Sunny, Cloudy, Partly Sunny).

🧩 Steps Performed
1️⃣ Data Loading & Understanding

Loaded dataset with Pandas

Checked shape, data types, null values, and statistical summary

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns

Renamed inconsistent column names

Handled missing values using mean imputation

Created Date column from Year, Month, and Day

Detected and handled outliers using IQR

3️⃣ Univariate Analysis

Analyzed numerical and categorical features

Plotted histograms, KDE plots, boxplots, and violin plots

Visualized distributions using Seaborn and Plotly

4️⃣ Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis

Scatterplots and correlation heatmaps for numeric relationships

Boxplots and barplots for categorical-numeric relationships

Pairplots to observe overall variable interactions

5️⃣ Insights & Queries

Average temperature for sunny days

Maximum wind speed in July on sunny days

Correlations between Ozone, Temperature, and Wind Speed

🧠 Key Learnings

Gained understanding of data preprocessing and visualization

Explored relationships between weather variables

Improved skills in EDA storytelling and insight extraction

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

📊 Sample Visualizations

KDE plots for numeric features

Correlation heatmap
